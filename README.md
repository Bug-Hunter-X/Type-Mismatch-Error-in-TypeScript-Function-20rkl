# Type Mismatch Error in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript and shows how to fix it. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from attempting to pass an array of strings to a function expecting a single string.
